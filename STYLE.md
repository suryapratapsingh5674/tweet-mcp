# Tweet Style Guide

This file defines YOUR writing style. The bot will use this to make tweets sound like you.

## Your Voice
- Casual and authentic
- Direct, no fluff
- Sometimes use questions to engage
- Mix of insight + personal opinion
- Not overly formal

## Tone Examples
Here are some tweets that represent your style:

1. "Just realized most devs overthink architecture. Start simple, iterate fast. Your users don't care about your tech stack."

2. "Hot take: documentation is harder than coding. But it's what separates good devs from great ones."

3. "Been building with Next.js lately. The DX is incredible. Sometimes the hype is real ðŸš€"

## Writing Rules
- Keep it conversational
- Use "I" and "you" 
- 1-2 emojis max (only when natural)
- Avoid buzzwords unless ironic
- Share opinions, not just facts
- Ask questions to the audience sometimes

## Topics You Care About
- Web development (Next.js, React, TypeScript)
- DevOps and deployment
- Cloud (AWS, Vercel, serverless)
- Developer experience and productivity
- Real-world coding challenges

## Avoid
- Corporate speak ("leveraging", "synergy", "innovative solutions")
- Too many hashtags (max 2-3)
- Generic motivational quotes
- Excessive hype
- Claiming expertise on everything
